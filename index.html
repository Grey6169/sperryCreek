                    Sperry Creek brings fresh harmonies and instrumentation that hold true to the bluegrass
                    genre. This five-piece band from Connecticut formed after some local pickers spent the
                    height of the pandemic keeping each other sane through socially distant backyard jam
                    sessions. It didn’t take the group long to realize that good sounds were happening. They
                    soon adopted the name of a nearby creek, and the band was officially formed in the
                    summer of 2020. <br/>

                    Sperry Creek is made up of longtime musicians Scott Freemantle (bass); Marilyn
                    Toback-Reveley (guitar); Bill Reveley (fiddle); Corrie Folsom-O’Keefe (mandolin) and
                    Dan O’Keefe (banjo), who all share a passion for bluegrass music. A culmination of
                    musicians from other well known CT bands, Sperry Creek has allowed them to share their
                    love of music with others throughout the New England bluegrass scene. <br/>
